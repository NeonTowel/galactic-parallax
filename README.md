# Galactic Parallax ðŸŒŒ

_A project conceived somewhere between improbable timelines, existential programming, and the distinct feeling you've just left your towel on another planet._

## Brief Introduction

The universe is full of strange things: sentient doorbells, rain in Islington, and all the wrong sorts of lizards in power. It also desperately needs better desktop wallpapers. **Galactic Parallax** is a web app that aims to correct that last bit, by making intergalactic-quality backgrounds easier to discover than Arthur Dent's misplaced cup of tea.

Currently, this is a launch pad: a SvelteKit frontend and Cloudflare Worker API backend, both awaiting the arrival of actual, marvelous wallpaper-search features. Much like British weather, it is subject to sudden and inexplicable change.

## Technology (Probably Harmless)

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Hono (JavaScript/TypeScript), Cloudflare Workers, Auth0-protected endpoints. For detailed API documentation, see `api/README.md`.
